- 👋 Hi, I’m @VELD-Dev
- :books: I study Industrial Sciences and Engineering, Mathematics and Physics.
- 👀 I’m interested in playing (and making) videogames, web/apps development, programming and mathematics.
- 🌱 I really love programming. Here's my top langauges based on my preferences:
  1. C# - It's like a swiss army knife, it's basically able to do anything. Strongly typed yet easy to handle. It's the language I instantly think about when I think about making something new (except Minecraft mods)
  2. Go - It's the perfect language for anything related to networking. I use it for every single of my REST APIs and distant game servers.
  3. C++ - I do not use it very much, but my experience with it have been really satisfying so far, especially in Unreal Engine.
  4. Python - Wooden swiss army knife, cool for tests but I wouldn't use it for anything too serious.
  5. Java - It's the discount version of C#. The syntax is not very comfortable for a C language regular, and Gradle and other stuff are really annoying imo.
